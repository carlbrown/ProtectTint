This is a game I wrote for the [360idev Game Jam](http://gamejam.360idev.com/) in 2010.  

It's just a quick prototype, more info [on my blog here](http://www.escortmissions.com/blog/tag/gamejam)- I might find the time to clean it up and submit it at some point, but for now, I might as well open source it.  Some one else might learn something from it, and even if I do release it, I doubt open sourcing it would hurt sales any.
